# FastAI and Jeremy Howard

Find a Resnet 

I began the FastAI book one year ago.  I managed a few examples before trying my own project...and then it was back to my Masters Program.  Attending a Univeristy now in 2021 is so different that when I first attained my BS.  7 weeks, One semester, week by week, very little time to explore.  This tight schedule coupled with a full time job is / was very difficult.

Nevertheless - reading the book during my Christmas break last year has skewed my learning process.  [TODO: What I think about learning today]

## Learning from the Top Down
The premise of the teaching method is that you learn better from the top down- that is - you learn how something works first, then circle back and study the parts that you don't understand.
The analogy is similar to learning a new sport, how to do something physical.

For baseball, you learn by doing.  You get out and swing a bat, you run around the bases.
What you **don't** do - is study a baseball.  The stitching.  The physics of a ball rotating and moving through air.  The physics of swinging a bat.  

Those concepts are important, but you need to understand and see the whole game to get put these ideas into perspective.  To give the game some **context**.
