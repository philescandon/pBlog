Nice lazy day here in the Northeast.  Temperature was right around freezing - 31 - 32 degrees and there was a light rain all day today.  The weather resulted in several big accidents throughout the day.
I'll call my mother later today.  We are having prime rib and a small ham.

Today I'm trying to make my blog and get the process down and written in my wiki on Github.  

This year I want to concentrate on checking in workable code with documentation.

I haven't posted any of my school work publicly, so that specific work won't be available until I finish the program.
