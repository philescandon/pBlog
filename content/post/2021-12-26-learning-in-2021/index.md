# The state of learning in 2021
I am completing my Masters at Boston University.  The classes have all been online, even though I live about 40 miles away.

I recieved my BS be attending a traditional univerisity.  Walking through campus to class, in a normal classroom setting, studying in a library study room with co-students.  It was good.
### What do I need to learn?

### What is important to know?

### Do i **need** to go to college?
MIT Opencourses
Coursera
Udacity



# Covid as an accelerant
The public schools have moved to distnace learning using Zoom etc.  The problem seems to be student engagement.  The typcial fear of speaking, cameras on, etc now factor into the learning experience.  But this has been the case for all learning situations.

Now because of Covid, almost all learning has become remote - online and learning resources and procedures such as recording, placing the recording online for students, this process has become ubiquitous.

Can **business** employ the same model for thier training programs?  
Can **we** do this at my place of employment?


# Learning as a business
The cost of higher education. Is it worth it?  How much is to0 much?


# Can you learn enough on YouTube?
Probably.

But you don't have any credentials.  How does your employer know that you have 'learned' a new skill on your own
