We got about 2 inches of snow last night. This morning was a quick snow blow. The problem will be tonight with the temperature going down to 9 degrees, any snow left out will be rock hard, so I'm glad I was able to move it. It's going to be a clear night.

Tonight we had a Harrow chicken pot pie and some macaroni and cheese with a salad. Sister in law, Son's girlfriend, Grammy and Vern, then we played a few board like games, on the TV. Good fun.

Tomorrow we will begin around 9 or 10. We don't have to get up super early since we are all adults now :).

When we were kids, it was always midnight mass (Catholic) then, and only then, we could open presents. Oh god, we would be so tired, but we would still play with our toys until we couldn't physically stay up any longer. With my wife, we follow her tradition now, which seems more plausible and sensible to me. We have always had our christmas and unwrapping of the gifts on Christmas Morning. We always have a family dinner on Christmas Eve. a breakfast egg casserole after we do the presents.

Then it'll just be a nice regular day.
I wish I could see mom and gary and my brother. Maybe next year.
