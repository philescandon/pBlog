This christmas break I'll be doing some research and fun learning! Last Christmas, I remember finding out about Deepseek a few days before Christmas and I played with that for a few days non-stop. Then it was on to Chatgpt, Claude, a few other chinese models, gemini, and so on.\
\
This Christmas break I am concentrating on a few specific items:

-   Anduril Systems\
    What do they do?\
    What do they sell?\
    How do they do it?\
    How can I do it?\
    I'll use claude research to figure this out.\

-   YOLO Algorithm\
    I want to use this as part of learning about the Lattice OS from Anduril.

-   Meteor Detection in images\
    I want to implement a YOLO model trained to detect meteors in my personal images. For night photography, I can take up to 500 images.. and go through each one looking for a meteor streak is time consuming. There must be a better way.

-   Photogrammertry\
    I need to review the topic for work specifics

-   Guitar and more guitar.\
    Learn some new songs. Practice, but make the practice count. Find the weak spots, work on that.

-   

For this coming year, I'm thinking not only of the things **I want**, what I want to **achieve**, but **what is required** of me and **what is expected** of me. What must to do to sustain my progress and arch this coming year.\
What can AI teach me in order to sustain myself?\
Good questions that I'll be wrestling with this year..\
