## _Keep it simple_

This is my personal blog as a try to migrate from pen and paper to computer.  I had a wordpress blog long ago, but I just like the physical act of writing.
Anyhow this will be an *online* version of my journal.  
The mundane day to day activities, life in suburbia, job decisions, school thoughts, the news and weather, blah blah blah.  
I'll probably write about it here.

I'm using a template from Yihui Xie.  He's pretty awesome - you should read a little about his background.  He's written a few R packages that I really enjoy.

**XMin** is a Hugo theme written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org) 

Although it is a minimal theme, it is actually fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS.
