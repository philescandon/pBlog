title: About Phil
---

**I'm** an engineer with Collins Aerospace.  I have a math degree from Texas State U and I'm completing my masters in Data Analytics from Boston University. I'll be finished in the Spring of 2022.  

I can see the potential in Machine Learning.  I'm hoping to become a better engineer by applying what I can.

I really enjoy using R and Python to solve real world issues that we have at work.  Sometimes is takes a while to iterate and iterate until you finally see the best approach to a problem.
I know and use matlab as well, but R is my favorite all around.  I have used powershell quite a bit as well.  It's amazing what you can do with a litte bit of knowledge of the basics.
